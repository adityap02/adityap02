### Hi There üëã I'm Aditya Porwal üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
As an aspiring software developer, I'm currently embarking on an exciting journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a Masters in Computer Science student at Syracuse University. My passion for technology and innovation has been the driving force behind my decision to specialize in AI, and I am eagerly dedicating my time and energy to acquiring the skills and knowledge required to excel in this dynamic field.

While my professional background includes three years of experience in software development, particularly in the Banking domain, I've now set my sights on the fascinating intersection of AI and technology. My previous role allowed me to gain proficiency in essential tools and practices, such as Java, Angular, Git, JIRA, Jenkins, Docker, and Jboss.

Current Focus and Aspirations:

AI Learning Journey: Actively engaged in pursuing advanced studies in AI, my goal is to become a proficient AI DevOps Engineer.
Passion for Innovation: Driven by a strong desire to leverage AI to drive innovation, automation, and transformative solutions.
Continuous Growth: Committed to lifelong learning and growth, I am dedicated to staying at the forefront of AI advancements.
I am actively seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and practical experience in AI. Whether through hands-on projects, collaborations, or internships, I am excited to immerse myself in this burgeoning field and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence.

If you share my enthusiasm for AI or if you're interested in connecting to explore potential collaborations or opportunities in this exciting space, I look forward to networking and forging valuable connections along this educational and professional journey.
